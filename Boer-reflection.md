What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- Haha, I feel like I have done enough git the last week where I felt like I understand everything.  Something I got wrong on the Quiz last week that I needed help this week with was git remote -v, which lets you view the repositories you are working in.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- We had trouble with the pathway for our included image.  But we figured it out that we have to include the entire pathway going back to the directory for it to work after being uploaded to GitHub.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- We asked what the fastest way to move files around from one directory to another in the Terminal and our guide admitted he still clicks and drags icons because it is faster than using the Terminal.  Other than that, my pair and I just followed the provided discussion questions and briefly talked about our impression of the program thus far.

What still confuses you about git?
- I have yet to use the git reset or git HEAD^ command.  I am still unsure when or why to do that.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
- It was a lot of fun.  I did not realize you could do screen capturing in Google Hangout, so that made it more interesting and obvious for me how pair programming was going to work with having a driver and a navigator.
