#GPS: Verson Control and Git

Phase 0, Dev Bootcamp
U1.W1. Guided Pairing Session: Version Control and Git

##Prompt:

Go through the git workflow to add, commit, make a pull request, and merge it to the master repo.

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
What still confuses you about git?
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

##Reflection:

Git workflow -

>1. Make changes to files in a git branch. These changes will be tracked and the files will be designated as modified.

>2. Add modified files to the staging environment, to be included in the next commit.

>3. Create a snapshot of the current branch by making a commit.

>4. Push your updated branch to the remote repository, and make a pull request for that branch to be merged with the branch upstream.

>5. Review changes in the pull request, and when satisfied, merge with the master repo.

I don't think I was struggling with any major git concepts prior to the GPS session, but I did get some clarification on how remote repositories interact with the local environment (for example, I learned that 'origin' is a somewhat arbitrary name for a remote repository and can be changed).

I also asked my guide if there were any shortcuts for moving files into other directories on your computer using the command line.  Do you have to type out the whole file path every time?  He suggested creating aliases if you use a particular directory often.  I also asked my pair for clarification on creating a relative link, and he helped me understand how that works.

In general, I don't think I have a lot of leftover confusion regarding git.  Trying to imagine a lot of project complexity, and how to deal with it, is in-and-of-itself a bit challenging.  However, I think once you have a real project to work on, all the advantages of git will become much clearer.

I wasn't really sure what to expect from a Guided Pairing Session.  I thought there would be a bit more guidance from the guide, but he mostly let us do our own thing unless we directly asked him a question.  That wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as we figured out everything else by ourselves anyway. The material was definitely a review, so the major challenge was learning how to interact and get something done with another person.  Overall, it was pretty fun.
